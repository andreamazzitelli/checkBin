# EVALUATION

To evaluate the performance of the system we expect to measure several factors:
- total energy consumption of the board, sensors and actuators
- total network usage on the LoRa gateway and on every single board
- final cost of the product
- percentage of inaccurate measurements in the bins
- difference between real fill level and measured fill level on a sample
- average fill level when bins are emptied

We’ll use simulation tools such as IoTLab, prototyping and measures taken directly on the field.

We will measure the effectiveness of the system through a two phase plan:
1. In the first phase we’ll use the device only to collect data and create a baseline.
2. In the second phase we’ll measure the same values after the company has changed its mode of operation using the data we provide. We will then compare this outcome with the baseline.

As an example we could apply this method to know how many bins were emptied before it was really needed or to measure the logistic costs before and after the changes (in terms of petrol used, needed vehicles and workers).

We will also use performance evaluation on energy consumption during the development phase to decide whether to use some sort of charging system for the battery.
